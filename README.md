# SQL
Using world data downloaded in an SQL file, provide some analysis of the data.
The first step was to create an SQL database, and from that we could use the SQL file into a database form, from which we could easily run some SQL queries to find the data we were looking for.

[Source World data](https://github.com/samborro/SQL/blob/main/world_db_script.sql)

## Analysis

Using the Source World Data, I was tasked with producing some analysis in SQL from the created database that showed the following:
1. Capital of Spain
2. Compile a list of cities located in Europe
3. Average Population by Country
4. Capital Cities Population Comparison

For each category, I provided a the input coding I used, as well as an accompanying output from the database, so you can easily see the results match what was expected.

### Results
